The issues are manifesting as latency of 8-12 seconds, which is unacceptable and has led to a breach of our service level agreement (SLA). Our investigation has revealed that the Redis cluster, comprising 4 nodes, is a key area of focus, and we are working closely with customer support to resolve the matter by the end of the day (EOD). However, we are facing constraints due to the database connection pool limit, which is limiting our ability to update the system more frequently than every 30 minutes. Unfortunately, our efforts so far have resulted in regression, and we urge immediate attention to prevent further deterioration of our services."

Our analysis indicates that the Redis cache hit rate is at 95%, which is a positive sign, but the connection pool configuration for the Redis cluster is a potential bottleneck. The database connection pool limit is a constraint that needs to be considered in our investigation. Furthermore, a review of the slow query logs is necessary to identify the root cause of the issue.
